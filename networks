Docker creates virtual interfaces for each container that are then bridged to the main network adapter.
Docker runs it own IP addresses for each container in a different subnet from your main network.
This offers isolation and allows each container to expose the same port but also explains why you cannot expose the same port on the host for each container.
Only a single container can bind to port 80 on the host but many containers can expose port 80.

To start lets create a second container that runs a basic http api that stores an input from the front end.
To do this we are going to be using a predefined application made using Golang and GIN included in this directory.
So lets turn ```backend``` into a dockerfile before we continue.
